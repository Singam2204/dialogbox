    <h1>Beauty of Nature</h1>
    <div class="one">
        <p>
            The beauty of nature lies in its freshness, openness, slow breeze and the warm sun – relief for our brains.
            Nature is made of everything we see around us the trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests
            and more. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.
            Many beautiful living things are among the countless riches of beauty that nature has to offer. Millions of
            different species in every size, colour, and habitat—on land, in the sky, and in the water—abound in the
            world of birds, animals, reptiles, and fish. They are present all the time and everywhere
